The Ultimate Binary Watch is a maker project that uses small LEDs to display time on a watch face. 
The display uses four columns of four LEDs each, with each column representing one digit of the current time in hours and minutes.
Time is displayed in $24$-hour format, with the $1$st (left-most) column displaying the tens position for hours,
the $2$nd column displaying the ones position for hours,
the $3$rd column displaying the tens position for minutes,
and the last (right-most) column displaying the ones position for minutes.
The bottom LED of each column shows the lowest-order bit of its represented digit, with the bit positions increasing moving up the column.
For example, the time $1615$ would be displayed as shown in the figure.

Write a program that will take a $24$-hour time and print the corresponding watch face.

\section*{Input}
The input has a single line with $4$ digits describing a valid $24$-hour time between $0000$ and $2359$.

\section*{Output}
Output four lines with a representation of the watch face displaying the given time. 
The tens of hours shall be in the $1$st column, the single hours in the $3$rd, the tens of minutes in the $7$th, and the single minutes in the $9$th. 
Use asterisks to represent bits that are set and periods to represent bits that are clear. 
Columns not used are to be filled with spaces. 
No extra whitespace are to appear at the beginning or end of any output line.
