There are four types of brackets: round {\tt ()}, square {\tt []}, curly {\tt \{\}}, and angle {\tt <>}.  A bracket sequence is defined to be {\it valid} as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item An empty sequence is valid.
\item If $X$ is a valid bracket sequence, then $pXq$ is a valid bracket sequence, where $p$ is an open bracket, $q$ is a close bracket, and $p, q$ are of the same type.
\item If $X$ and $Y$ are valid bracket sequences, then the concatenation of $X$ and $Y$, $Z = XY$, is a valid bracket sequence.
\end{itemize}

You have a bracket sequence in which some brackets are given, but the others are unknown and represented by question marks (`{\tt ?}').
You shall fill in each unknown bracket using the four types of brackets described above and obtain a valid bracket sequence.
How many different valid bracket sequences can you obtain?

\section*{Input}
The input has a single line giving a non-empty bracket sequence.
The length of the sequence is even and no larger than $20$.
All sequence characters are either one of the four types of open or close brackets, or a question mark denoting an unknown bracket.
There is at least one question mark in the sequence.

\section*{Output}
Output the number of different valid bracket sequences you can obtain.
